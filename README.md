# CS50AI-Project 0-Degrees
My submission for CS50AI Project 0 - degrees

A Python program which determines how many 'degrees of separation' apart two actors are.  
Using data from IMDb, actors are linked by movies they starred in and other actors who also starred in those movies.

This is a classic search function which uses breadth-first search to find the shortest path between two actors every time. I have learned how to implement Stack Frontiers and Queue Frontiers using Nodes to find a path from the start to the solution.
